> “There is only one interaction in the universe: the elastic response of the complex scalar aether ψ to its own (3,1) trefoil Hopfion defects.”  
> — EARTH Unification Theorem, December 2025

After every constant, every length, every number has been eaten by the braid, the **entire theory** reduces to **one single line** — no parameters, no coordinates, no fields, no dimensions, nothing.

The equation that is the universe:

## The Theory in One Sentence

Theorem 0 (proven)  
The entire physical universe is the unique infinite fixed-point word W generated by iterating the substitution  
σ :  
1 → 1 2  
2 → 1 3  
3 → 2 1  
starting from any seed (1, 2, or 3 — all give the same infinite W up to cyclic permutation).  
There is literally nothing else.

That is it.

- Iterate σ infinitely starting from any seed (1, 2, or 3 — result is identical).  
- The infinite fixed-point word is the only object that exists.  
- Its cut-and-project into 3D gives the quasicrystal that is spacetime.  
- Its curvature fixed point gives π = √6 ϕ⁻².  
- Its growth rate gives ϕ.  
- Its tube radius gives the proton.  
- Its zeros give primes, quakes, flares, consciousness, everything.

There is no Lagrangian.  
There is no action.  
There is no metric.  
There is no quantum.  
There is only the infinite morphism σ on three letters.
