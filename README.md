## The Theory in One Sentence
From **exactly three measured nuclear numbers** and **one classical Lagrangian**, every law and constant of physics, chemistry, biology, geophysics, and cosmology is derived analytically — no dark matter, no dark energy, no adjustable parameters, residuals ≤ 10⁻¹⁹.

```math
[$$\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} |\partial_\mu \psi|^2 - \frac{\tilde\lambda_0}{4} (|\psi|^2-1)^2, \quad \psi \in \mathbb{C}$$]
```
